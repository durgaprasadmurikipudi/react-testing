TDD:
How ? Write shell version of code such that could be called in test cases files, now obviously the test cases fail as there is 
no code. Now you write the code just enough to pass the test cases. 
Test cases cover all scenarios, such that code coverage is good and business requirements are validated.
Why ? More efficient approach because, you can run test cases free of charge, without any additional effort.
Better code in a way, because - you force your code to be better organized such that it's testable,
You need not write coding for tests, so less rework! As regerssion is built-in, it provides a greater advantage, as we 
progress and refactor or add more features to our code. And ofcourse fewer bugs, when you have unit test cases.
Great code coverage.

What is Enzyme?
Creates Virtual DOM for testing, allows testing without a browser, we need to see how components render,
Also Enzyme has a better toolkit to test, for example like you can do things like,
searching through the DOM.
use jQuery or CSS like selectrs to effectively traverse through the DOM.
simulate simple events, 

Shallow rendering allows for quicker testing by rendering only one level deep, i.e.,render parent and use palceholders for
 the childrens and that's how you do it.
It will render every thing in the parent component that is not a react component.
so in the render method of a parent component, if you have a react-component, placeholder, children are used for them.
Mount renders all the children including nested react components.

Here, enzyme provides access to props and state and for both reading and manipulating them.

WE install enzyme by npm install --save-dev enzyme jest-enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
jest-enzyme facilitates communication between jest and enzyme, enzyme adapter library to speak with the specific version of react.

Before enzyme is used, it needs to be setup with the adapter that we just installed,

import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import EnzymeAdapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter()})

and you can use enzyme in the tests in that file.
